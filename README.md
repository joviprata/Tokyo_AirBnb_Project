### Analysis Process <a name="AnalysisProcess"></a>

- **Step 1** - **Gather relevant data** to create this analysis through publicly available open data sources.
- **Step 2** - **Process data** to ensure that it is ready Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
- **Step 3** - **Explore data** to to identify patters and trends from the data that answer questions related to the business task.
- **Step 4** - **Visualize data** that is discovered through EDA to gain better visual representation and understanding of the data story.
- **Step 5** - Present **insights and recommendations** by exporting figures and charts created during EDA to create a comprehensive report and documentation and by creating a dynamic Tableau dashboard.

## Step 1 - Gather relevant data <a name="Gatherrelevantdata"></a>

The [raw data](data/raw/listings.csv) was taken from [Inside AirBnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), an official AirBnb open data source that has AirBnb data from dozens of cities and countries around the world.

## Step 2 - Process data <a name="Processdata"></a>

This process created the [clean data](/data/clean/cleaned_listings.csv) used for exploration and analysis is created using the [dataset-v1.0.py](scripts/data/dataset-v1.0.py) script shown below.

<details>

<summary>ðŸ‘€ see code for data cleaning </summary>

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read file from root .\data\raw\
script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
listings_file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "../../data/raw/listings.csv")

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
df_listings = pd.read_csv(listings_file_path)
```

Read data from the [raw data folder](data/raw/) and as a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
# Cleaning df_listings
listings_clean = (
    df_listings.copy()
)  # Creating copy of the df_listings before making changes

# Cleaning column names since they contain white spaces
listings_clean.columns = listings_clean.columns.str.strip().str.lower()
listings_clean = (
    listings_clean.drop(
        columns=[
            "neighbourhood_group",
            "minimum_nights",
            "number_of_reviews",
            "last_review",
            "reviews_per_month",
            "calculated_host_listings_count",
            "availability_365",
            "number_of_reviews_ltm",
            "license",
        ]
    ).drop_duplicates()  # Dropping duplicate data
)

# Quick check to see if changes were made
listings_clean.head()
listings_clean.info()

# Replacing non-ASCII characters with blank spaces.
listings_clean["name"] = listings_clean["name"].apply(
    lambda x: "" if any(ord(char) > 127 for char in x) else x
)
listings_clean["host_name"] = listings_clean["host_name"].apply(
    lambda x: "" if any(ord(char) > 127 for char in x) else x
)

# Replace empty strings in the 'price' column with NaN.
listings_clean["price"] = pd.to_numeric(
    listings_clean["price"].replace("", np.nan), errors="coerce"
)

# Drop rows with NaN values in 'price'
listings_clean = listings_clean.dropna(subset=["price"])

# Convert to int64 (this removes decimal places)
listings_clean["price"] = listings_clean["price"].astype(int)

# Create a copy of the cleaned listings DataFrame
df_listings_cleaned = listings_clean.copy()

print(df_listings_cleaned.head)
```

Code for data cleaning as seen in the [dataset-v1.0.py](scripts/data/dataset-v1.0.py) script.

```python
# Creating directory path for export of cleaned data.
clean_data_dir = os.path.join("..", "..", "data", "clean")
cleaned_listings_export_path = os.path.abspath(
    os.path.join(script_dir, clean_data_dir, "cleaned_listings.csv")
)

# Exporting cleaned data to directory.
df_listings_cleaned.to_csv(cleaned_listings_export_path, index=False)
print("Data Cleaning Completed!")
```

exporting data to [processed data folder](data/processed/).

## Step 3 - Explore data <a name="Exploredata"></a>

Data exploration on the [cleaned data](data/clean/cleaned_listings.csv) is done using the [eda-v1.0.py](scripts/data/eda-v1.0.py) script shown below.

<details>

<summary>ðŸ‘€ see code for data cleaning </summary>

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
data_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "../../data/clean/cleaned_listings.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

df.head()  # Inspect the first few rows
df.info()  # Get basic info about the dataset
df.isnull().sum()  # Check for missing values
df.describe()  # Summary statistics for numerical columns
df.median(numeric_only=True)  # Calculate Median for numerical columns
df.mode(numeric_only=True).iloc[0]  # Calculate Mode for numerical columns
df.nunique()  # Unique values count for categorical columns

# Distribution of Listings Across Neighborhoods
df["neighbourhood"].value_counts()

# Correlation Analysis
# Select only the numerical columns for the correlation matrix
numerical_df = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
correlation_matrix = numerical_df.corr()  # Create the correlation matrix
price_correlations = correlation_matrix["price"].sort_values(
    ascending=False
)  # Focus on correlation with 'price'
print("Price Correlations:\n", price_correlations)

# Distribution and Analysis of Key Metrics
# Listings count by Host
listings_per_host = (
    df.groupby("host_id")
    .size()
    .sort_values(ascending=False)
    .reset_index(name="listings_count")
)
print("Listings per Host:\n", listings_per_host)

# Summary statistics for neighborhoods
neighbourhood_stats = (
    df.groupby("neighbourhood")["price"]
    .agg(["count", "mean", "median", "std"])
    .sort_values("count", ascending=False)
    .reset_index()
)
print("Neighbourhood Stats:\n", neighbourhood_stats)
print("\nEND OF EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS!")
```

  - **Ome Shi** and **Meguro Ku** have the fewest listings (21 and 49, respectively) with only 15 and 49 hosts, making them potentially lucrative areas for new entrants.
  - These neighborhoods have fewer competitors while still maintaining relatively high average prices, suggesting potential for growth with less risk.

<br />

- **Most Competitive Neighborhoods:**
  - **Shinjuku Ku** and **Taito Ku** lead in competition with the highest number of listings (2,897 and 1,711, respectively).
  - **Shibuya Ku** has fewer listings (977) but maintains a high average rate, suggesting it is a sought-after location with strong demand.

<br />

- **Least Competitive Neighborhoods (Top 5)**
  - **Chuo Ku** so far leads in all categories being the second to the highest in terms of average price (Â¥26,597) but having relatively low competition with only 49 competitor host and 232 listings.
  - Other less competitive neighborhoods include **Ome Shi** and **Meguro Ku**, with minimal listings (21 and 49, respectively) and hosts (15 and 49), presenting further opportunities for market penetration with less competitive pressure.
  
<br />

>- **Demand for Room Types:**
>    - ... TBD ... Higher prices in neighborhoods like **Shibuya Ku** and **Chuo Ku** could indicate a preference for premium or entire home listings.

### Recommendations <a name="Recommendations"></a>

- **Capitalize on Chuo Ku's High Price and Low Competition:** Focus on entering the market in **Chuo Ku**, where the potential for high earnings meets relatively low competition. Developing properties with unique offerings or upscale amenities could attract premium guests and maximize profits.

<br />

- **Capitalize on High-Rate Neighborhoods:** Maintain a presence in premium areas like **Shibuya Ku** and **Minato Ku**. Consider investing in unique or high-end properties that cater to international tourists and business travelers, given their willingness to pay above-average rates.

<br />

- **Differentiate in Competitive Markets:** In more saturated areas like **Taito Ku**, **Shibuya Ku**, and **Minato Ku**, stand out by offering specialized stays (e.g., themed properties or local partnerships) that cater to niche markets or unique guest experiences.
<br />

- **Expand in Low-Competition Areas:** Target other less competitive neighborhoods like **Ome Shi** for new listings, leveraging the neighborhood's untapped potential while maintaining competitive pricing.

<br />

- **Explore Room Type Demand:** Further analysis is needed to understand room type preferences in these neighborhoods. Focus on offering a mix of room types (e.g., entire homes, private rooms) tailored to the target audience's needs in the selected neighborhoods.

### Conclusion

By strategically entering low-competition, high-potential neighborhoods such as **Chuo Ku** and effectively differentiating offerings in more competitive areas, Airbnb hosts can optimize profitability and gain a stronger foothold in Tokyo's dynamic market. Further understanding of room type demand will refine these strategies, ensuring a successful and sustainable Airbnb business.
